# BrickBreakerGame
My first Java project

I want to make an interactive game based upon the classic game brick breaker. The object of brick breaker is to break the bricks that are distributed around the topof the game screen. The bricks get broken after coming in contact with a ball that bounces around the screen. At the bottom is a paddle that in the classic game moves based on user input. The user has to make sure the ball bounces off the paddle without going off the bottom of the screen.

The paddle doesnâ€™t bounce the ball like a mirror, although it does so when the ball hits right in the middle. The closer the bounce take place to the left end of the paddle, a more significant left turn is added to an expected mirror bouncing. 

I will build a scoring system that reflects how efficient the user is to clear the bricks. Number of total paddle hits and maximum brick hits per trip are two of the possible factors.
